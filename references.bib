  abstract = {In this paper it is shown how the duality theory of mathematical programming can be applied to many kinds of optimization problems in mathematical economics, even if no objective functions is available, and the usual definition of optimality is replaced by so-called weak optimality. In the latter case only a slight reformulation of the Lagrange problem is required. Two theorems are shown for abstract time-lagged optimization problems over a countably infinite number of periods. The first one is concerned with introducing the multipliers all at once, leading to the consideration of purely finitely additive multipliers, whereas the second one is concerned with introducing them one by one. In general the paper stresses the method of obtaining duality results.}

  abstract = {Optimal supply chain design is vital to the success of industrial concerns now more than ever before. This paper reviews some principal research opportunities and challenges in the field of supply chain design. The growing area of enterprise-wide optimization and the increasing importance of energy and sustainability issues provide plentiful opportunities for supply chain design research. However, modeling, algorithmic, and computational challenges arise from these research opportunities. There are three major technical challenge areas where knowledge gaps can be addressed in supply chain design, namely multi-scale challenges, multi-objective and sustainability challenges, and multi-player challenges. This paper provides an overview of opportunity areas, a description of relevant technical challenges, and a perspective on how these challenges might be addressed in supply chain design. Illustrative examples are presented to illuminate avenues for future research.}
